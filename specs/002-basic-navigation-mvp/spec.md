# Feature Specification: Basic Navigation MVP

**Feature Branch**: `002-basic-navigation-mvp`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Basic Navigation MVP (foundation):
- As a user, when I open the app I land on a **Dashboard** page at "/" that shows a short greeting and some placeholder info.
- From the Dashboard I can navigate to the existing **Goals** page at "/goals" via a clear link/button.
- The application MUST use a **dark theme by default** in this feature (no theme switcher yet).
Constraints: frontend-only; reuse existing modules; **no backend changes**; single-user; keep it simple and clean.
Success: I can open "/", see the Dashboard, and navigate to "/goals" in one click. The UI renders in dark mode by default."

## Execution Flow (main)
Parse user description from Input
‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"

Extract key concepts from description
‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

For each unclear aspect:
‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]

Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"

Generate Functional Requirements
‚Üí Use normative wording (MUST / SHOULD / MAY)

Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

Normalize the document
‚Üí Remove stray control/garbled characters
‚Üí Ensure Acceptance Scenarios are numbered 1..N (sub-cases: 2.1, 2.2)

Run Review Checklist
‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"

Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**
- ‚ùå Avoid **HOW** to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üß≠ Use **clear, testable** language (MUST / SHOULD / MAY)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark ambiguities** with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]`
2. **Don't guess** missing policies; propose a short recommended default **inside** the clarification (e.g., "recommended UUIDv4")
3. **Think like a tester**: each requirement must be **verifiable**
4. Common underspecified areas:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - **Data formats (IDs, timestamps), sorting field/order**

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to access a central Dashboard as the main entry point to the application, where I can see a welcoming greeting and placeholder information. From this Dashboard, I need to be able to navigate directly to the Goals page to view and manage my goals. The entire interface should be presented in a dark theme to provide a comfortable viewing experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I navigate to the application root ("/"), **When** the page loads, **Then** I MUST see a Dashboard page with a greeting message and placeholder information
2. **Given** I am on the Dashboard page, **When** I look at the interface, **Then** the application MUST render in dark theme by default
3. **Given** I am on the Dashboard page, **When** I look for navigation options, **Then** I MUST see a clear link or button to navigate to the Goals page
4. **Given** I am on the Dashboard and I click the Goals navigation link/button, **When** the navigation completes, **Then** I MUST be taken to the "/goals" page
5. **Given** I am on the Goals page, **When** I navigate back to "/" using browser navigation or a link, **Then** I MUST return to the Dashboard page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user navigates directly to "/goals" without visiting the Dashboard first? (The Goals page should still be accessible and render correctly in dark theme)
- What happens when the user uses browser back/forward buttons? (Navigation should work correctly and maintain dark theme throughout)
- What happens when the user refreshes the page while on the Dashboard? (The Dashboard should reload and display correctly with dark theme)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a Dashboard page when users navigate to the root path ("/")
- **FR-002**: Dashboard page MUST include a greeting message for the user
- **FR-003**: Dashboard page MUST display placeholder information (descriptive content about the application or upcoming features)
- **FR-004**: System MUST render the entire application in a dark theme by default (no light mode or theme switcher in this feature)
- **FR-005**: Dashboard MUST provide a clear and visible navigation element (link or button) to access the Goals page
- **FR-006**: Navigation element MUST direct users to the "/goals" route when activated
- **FR-007**: Navigation from Dashboard to Goals MUST complete in a single user interaction (one click)
- **FR-008**: Goals page MUST be accessible and functional when reached from the Dashboard
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain dark theme consistently across all pages (Dashboard and Goals)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support standard browser navigation (back/forward buttons, direct URL access)

### Conventions & Formats *(include if data/APIs involved)*
This feature is frontend-only with no data persistence or API interaction. No specific data formats are required for this MVP.
