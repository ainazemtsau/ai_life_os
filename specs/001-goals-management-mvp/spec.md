## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: How should the system handle goal modifications across multiple browser tabs/devices for the same user? → A: Last-write-wins (most recent save overwrites previous changes without conflict detection)
- Q: What is the acceptable maximum title length? → A: 255 characters
- Q: What is the expected data persistence behavior? Should goals persist across browser sessions? → A: Server-side persistence (goals persist to backend database)
- Q: What should be the default sort order when displaying the list of goals? → A: Active first, then done (group by completion status, then by date)
- Q: How should the system behave when the backend is unavailable? → A: Block UI with error message, disable all actions until backend recovers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to manage my personal goals so that I can track what I want to accomplish and monitor my progress. I need to create new goals, see all my goals in a list, update their details or mark them as done, delete goals I no longer want to track, and filter between active and completed goals. The system should provide clear feedback when I perform actions and validate my input to prevent mistakes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the goals interface, **When** I create a new goal with a title, **Then** the goal appears in my active goals list with creation timestamp and is persisted to the backend
2. **Given** I have existing goals persisted in the backend, **When** I view the goals list, **Then** I see all goals with their titles and completion status
2a. **Given** I close and reopen my browser, **When** I view the goals interface, **Then** my previously created goals are still available (persisted across sessions)
3. **Given** I have a goal in my list, **When** I edit its title, **Then** the goal's title is updated and the update timestamp is refreshed
4. **Given** I have a goal in my list, **When** I mark it as done, **Then** the goal's completion status changes and the update timestamp is refreshed
5. **Given** I have a goal in my list, **When** I delete it, **Then** the goal is permanently removed from my list
6. **Given** I have both active and completed goals, **When** I filter by active goals, **Then** I see only goals that are not marked as done
7. **Given** I have both active and completed goals, **When** I filter by completed goals, **Then** I see only goals that are marked as done
8. **Given** I attempt to create a goal, **When** I submit without a title, **Then** I receive a clear validation error message
9. **Given** I perform any action, **When** the action succeeds, **Then** I receive a clear success confirmation
10. **Given** I perform any action, **When** the action fails, **Then** I receive a clear error message explaining what went wrong

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user attempts to create a goal with an empty or whitespace-only title?
- What happens when a user edits a goal in one browser tab/device while simultaneously modifying it in another? (Last-write-wins: most recent save overwrites without conflict detection)
- How does the system handle goal titles exceeding 255 characters? (System must reject with validation error)
- What happens when filtering with no goals matching the filter criteria?
- How does the system behave when there are no goals at all?
- What happens when the backend is unavailable? (System displays error message and disables all actions until connection restored)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core CRUD Operations
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create a new goal by providing a title
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically assign a unique identifier to each goal upon creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically record creation and update timestamps for each goal
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all goal data to a backend database
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain goal data across browser sessions (persistent storage)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a list of all user goals showing title and completion status
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to edit the title of an existing goal
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to toggle the completion status of an existing goal
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the modification timestamp whenever a goal is edited
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to permanently delete a goal
- **FR-011**: System MUST remove deleted goals from all views and backend storage

#### Filtering and Sorting
- **FR-012**: System MUST display goals with active goals first, followed by completed goals
- **FR-013**: System MUST sort goals by date within each completion status group
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to filter goals to show only active (not done) goals
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to filter goals to show only completed (done) goals
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to view all goals regardless of completion status

#### Validation and Feedback
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate that goal titles are not empty or whitespace-only
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that goal titles do not exceed 255 characters
- **FR-019**: System MUST display clear error messages when validation fails
- **FR-020**: System MUST display clear success messages when operations complete successfully
- **FR-021**: System MUST prevent creation or saving of goals with invalid data

#### Error Handling and Reliability
- **FR-022**: System MUST detect when backend connection is unavailable
- **FR-023**: System MUST display a clear error message when backend is unavailable
- **FR-024**: System MUST disable all user actions when backend is unavailable
- **FR-025**: System MUST restore full functionality when backend connection is re-established

#### User Experience
- **FR-026**: System MUST present a simple and readable user interface for goal management
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide clear visual distinction between active and completed goals

#### Architectural Requirements
- **FR-028**: System MUST use modular architecture with strict public surface boundaries
- **FR-029**: System MUST document all public APIs with manifest and contract files
- **FR-030**: System MUST ensure modules interact only through published public interfaces
- **FR-031**: System MUST maintain documentation in sync with any public API changes
- **FR-032**: System MUST version public APIs using semantic versioning
- **FR-033**: System MUST not expose internal implementation details across module boundaries

#### Scope and Privacy
- **FR-034**: System MUST support single-user scope (no multi-user functionality required)
- **FR-035**: System MUST respect user privacy by not exposing implementation details
- **FR-036**: System MUST use last-write-wins strategy for concurrent edits across multiple browser tabs/devices (most recent save overwrites without conflict detection)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Goal**: Represents a personal objective or task the user wants to accomplish. Contains a unique identifier, descriptive title, completion status (done or not done), timestamp of when it was created, and timestamp of when it was last modified. Goals exist within a single-user scope and can be filtered by completion status.
