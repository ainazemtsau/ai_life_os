# AI Life OS Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-First Architecture
Every component must be designed with AI integration in mind; All systems must support AI decision-making capabilities; Clear AI interaction protocols required - no components without AI interfaces

### Autonomous Operation
The system must function independently with minimal human intervention; All processes must have self-monitoring and self-healing capabilities; Resilience through AI-driven adaptation to changing conditions

### Adaptive Learning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Continuous learning from user interactions and environment: Data collected → AI models trained → System behavior improved; All learning cycles must be verified for safety and ethics

### Privacy-First Design
Focus areas requiring privacy protection: User data encryption, Consent management, Data anonymization, Privacy-preserving algorithms

### Safety & Ethics
AI behavior must be transparent and explainable; Ethical guidelines must be embedded in decision-making; Safety measures prevent harmful AI actions

## Security Requirements

All AI models must be secured from adversarial attacks; Multi-layer authentication for system access; Encryption of all user data at rest and in transit

## Development Workflow

All code changes must include AI behavior tests; Peer reviews verify ethical AI compliance; Deployment requires safety validation

## Governance

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with AI ethics; Complexity must be justified with safety measures; Use of interpretable AI models prioritized over black-box solutions
